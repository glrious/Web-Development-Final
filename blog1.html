      Starting college as a first-generation student and a first-generation Togolese-American was both exciting and overwhelming. I don't remember my first day very well but I remember the feeling; the scramble between classes, being overwhelmed and scared of a new environment far from home, and the pressure to figure out what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. 
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, I leaned toward 3D Digital Design and VFX, thinking about becoming a VFX artist for big motion pictures or possibly PIXAR. But over time, I found myself drawn more and more toward technology, and kept worrying about the future of my job field. I loved editing videos, exploring how journalism content works (since I did that in highschool), and dabbled with the idea of learning to code. That curiosity led me to choose Computer Science as my majorâ€”with a minor in Electronic Media & Broadcasting to feed my creative side.

      Balancing both disciplines has been incredibly rewarding. Coding gives me structure and logic, while media gives me expression. It hasn't been easy, but every struggle helped me find what truly excites me.
    </p>
    <p>
      For any student still figuring it out: trust the process. Explore, ask questions, and give yourself room to grow. You'll find your path.
